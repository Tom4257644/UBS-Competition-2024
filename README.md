<h1>UBS Competition 2024</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This was a national investment banking competition run by UBS, the task of which was to pitch a merger or acquisition to a panel of UBS judges and then answer their questions related to the pitch. We pitched Vulcan Steel Acquiring a mine, Metro Mining Limited, to take advantage of large raw materials savings through vertical integration. The pitch went very well; we made it through the heats round and into the finals at the UBS offices in Auckland, and in the end, we managed to come third, a result we were extremely pleased with as first years. I was also lucky enough to be awarded a prize for 'Best single answer to a question'.
